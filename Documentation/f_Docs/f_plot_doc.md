## Summary
This code defines a function called `plot_eua` that plots the EU ETS price with additional events marked on the graph.

## Example Usage
```python
date = [datetime(2019, 1, 1), datetime(2019, 1, 2), datetime(2019, 1, 3)]
eua = [10, 15, 12]
br_date = [datetime(2019, 1, 2)]
br_value = [15]
ph_date = datetime(2019, 1, 2)
plot_eua(date, eua, br_date, br_value, ph_date)
```
This code will plot the EU ETS price with the given dates and prices. It will also mark the Brexit date and the change of phase date on the graph.

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `date` (list): A list of dates.
- `eua` (list): A list of EU ETS prices.
- `br_date` (list): A list of Brexit dates.
- `br_value` (list): A list of Brexit values.
- `ph_date` (datetime): The date of change of phase.
___
### Flow
1. Create a figure and axes for the plot.
2. Plot the EU ETS prices using the `date` and `eua` lists.
3. Plot the Brexit dates and values as markers on the graph.
4. Plot a vertical line at the change of phase date.
5. Fill the area between the EU ETS prices and the x-axis with a color for the COVID-19 pandemic period.
6. Fill the area between the EU ETS prices and the x-axis with a color for the energy crisis period.
7. Add a legend to the graph.
8. Set the y-axis label to "Price" and the x-axis label to "Time".
9. Show the plot.
___
### Outputs
- `fig` (matplotlib.figure.Figure): The figure object representing the plot.

## Summary
This code defines a function called `plot_corr_3` that plots the correlations for phase 3 using a bar chart. It takes a pandas DataFrame `correlations_3` as input and returns the figure and axes objects.

## Example Usage
```python
import pandas as pd
correlations = pd.DataFrame({'A': [0.5, 0.7, 0.9], 'B': [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]})
plot_corr_3(correlations)
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `correlations_3` (pandas.DataFrame): The correlation data for phase 3.
___
### Flow
1. Create a new figure and axes object using `plt.subplots()`.
2. Plot the correlations as a bar chart using `correlations_3.plot(kind='bar', color='k', alpha=0.7, figsize=(8, 4))`.
3. Add additional bars to highlight specific correlations using `plt.bar()`.
4. Set the y-axis label to 'Correlation Coefficient' using `plt.ylabel()`.
5. Add a grid to the plot using `plt.grid()`.
6. Set the title of the plot to 'Correlations - Phase 3' using `plt.title()`.
7. Change the color of specific x-axis tick labels using `ax.get_xticklabels()[index].set_color()`.
___
### Outputs
- `fig` (matplotlib.figure.Figure): The figure object.
- `ax` (matplotlib.axes.Axes): The axes object.

## Summary
This code defines a function called `plot_corr_4` that plots correlations for phase 4. It takes a pandas DataFrame called `correlations_4` as input and returns a matplotlib figure and axes object.

## Example Usage
```python
correlations_4 = pd.DataFrame(...)
fig, ax = plot_corr_4(correlations_4)
plt.show()
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
